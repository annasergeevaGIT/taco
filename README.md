# Taco Cloud

Taco Cloud is a full-stack web application that allows users to design custom tacos, place orders, and validate delivery and payment information. Built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, the application is containerized using Docker, uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage, and integrates Spring Actuator for monitoring. APIs are tested via Postman.

## Features

- **Taco Design:** Customize tacos by choosing from various ingredients like wraps, proteins, cheeses, veggies, and sauces.
- **Order Submission:** Review taco selections and submit an order with delivery and payment details.
- **Server-Side Validation:** Input is validated on the server using annotations such as `@NotBlank`, `@Pattern`, and `@Digits`.
- **Session Management:** Manage orders through session attributes, allowing users to design multiple tacos before placing the order.
- **Responsive UI:** Render a user-friendly interface using Thymeleaf templates styled with CSS.

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot** for building the web application.
- **Spring MVC** for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Thymeleaf** for server-side HTML templating.
- **Hibernate Validator** for bean validation.
- **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code.
- **Maven** for project build and dependency management.

### Usage
#### Design Your Taco:
Navigate to /design to create your custom taco by selecting ingredients. The selected ingredients are stored in the session as you design each taco.

#### Place Your Order:
Once your taco designs are ready, go to /orders/current to review your order, enter delivery information, and provide payment details. Validation errors will be displayed next to the form fields using Thymeleaf and CSS.

### Validation & Error Handling
The application uses Spring’s validation framework with Hibernate Validator to enforce:

Non-empty fields (e.g., delivery name, street, city, state, zip code).

Properly formatted credit card numbers and expiration dates.

Numeric validation for fields like CVV.

Validation errors are displayed next to the form fields using Thymeleaf error attributes and styled via CSS.
